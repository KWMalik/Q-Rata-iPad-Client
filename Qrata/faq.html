    <b><i>QRata</i></b>?</span><br />
    <br /></a> <b><i><span class='c15'>QRata&acirc;&euro;&trade;s</span></i></b>
    <span class='c16'>mission is simple:</span></p>

    <p><span class='c16'>Save you time finding the most reliable, exceptional content
    while avoiding risky content.</span></p>

    <p><span class='c16'>The Internet is a vast library of important information.
    Unfortunately much of it is not reliable or up-to-date, and thus risky to use.
    Additionally, there are lots of malicious and bad services that could harm you.
    <b><i>QRata&acirc;&euro;&trade;s</i></b> job is to separate and identify superior,
    need-to-know, high-utility content affecting your quality of life from all the
    rest.</span></p>

    <p><span class='c3'>What does the word <b><i>QRata</i></b> mean?</span></p>

    <p><span class='c16'>It is a word we created. The Q stands for quality and rata, as
    in Latin, stands for rating. Thus, together, <b><i>QRata</i></b> is meant to
    represent &acirc;&euro;&oelig;quality ratings&acirc;&euro; - for you.</span></p>

    <p><span class='c12'>What is <b><i>QRata</i></b> exactly?</span><br />
    <br />
    <b><i><span class='c15'>QRata</span></i></b> <span class='c16'>is your "Ratings
    Library." Like a dictionary or encyclopedia, <b><i>QRata</i></b> is an on-demand
    reference resource focused on:</span></p>

    <p><span class='c17'><span>1.<span class='c9'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>
    <span class='c18'>Need-to-know, high-utility topics important to your daily quality
    of life issues.</span></p>

    <p><span class='c17'><span>2.<span class='c9'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>
    <span class='c18'>Aggregating the knowledge of both experts and users into one
    convenient site or app.</span></p>

    <p><span class='c17'><span>3.<span class='c9'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>
    <span class='c18'>Helping you find the most reliable, accurate, and up-to-date
    content available faster and easier than any other service.</span></p>

    <p><span class='c17'><span>4.<span class='c9'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></span>
    <span class='c18'>Where search ends and knowledge begins!</span></p>

    <p><a name="basics_3" id="basics_3"><span class='c19'>What are need-to-know,
    high-utility topics and how are they selected?</span><br />
    <br /></a> <span class='c17'>Need-to-know, high-utility topics are the type of
    information you need in to improve the quality of your life, personally or
    professionally. It is also the type of information we all take for granted until we
    need it. Information you do not realize you need until an important situation or
    decision arises that would benefit greatly from having it. When that occurs the
    information is often needed immediately to help with the pending action, decision or
    situation, especially if you think unreliable information could be potentially risky
    or harmful.</span></p>

    <p><span class='c16'>Consequently, this type of information is not usually something
    you would be readily familiar with or would have saved in your list of favorites. Nor
    is it the type of content you want or are able to invest a large amount of limited
    time randomly searching the Internet and trying to identify quality content you know
    little about in the first place and have limited skill to evaluate effectively. So,
    when you need this type of content you want it fast and want to know it is reliable.
    <b><i>QRata</i></b> contracts with topic experts and listens to user suggestions to
    identify need-to-know, high-utility topics and includes only the most reliable
    content available</span></p>

    <p><a name="basics_4" id="basics_4"><span class='c12'>Who selects, evaluates and

    most reliable &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; accurate, up-to-date, quality - content within
    their area of expertise. These experts carefully analyze and evaluate the quality of
    information offered in each relevant site, app and video and rate each based on a
    list of criteria. Then, to insure our experts have not missed anything important,
    <b><i>QRata</i></b> offers a cash reward to anyone who points out any content

    <span class='c20'>Regular old search engines &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; are</span>
    <span class='c16'>random algorithmic searches delivering a list of tens or hundreds
    of thousands of possible, so-called &acirc;&euro;&oelig;relevant&acirc;&euro;&trade;
    results. Fact is the search engine cannot evaluate the quality of content and so
    cannot indicate what is reliable, accurate, or even current. Worse, between results
    that pay to be at the top of a search results list and search engine optimization
    (SEO) techniques to trick the algorithm to be at the top, relevant often means you
    get lots of results that are mediocre, junk and or outright bad. Consequently, every
    time you need-to-know important, high utility content that might affect the quality
    of your life, you must be smart enough in that topic and or be able to invest enough
    time to evaluate every listed result and judge for yourself what is reliable.
    <b><i>QRata</i></b> prescreen Internet content and only gives you the most reliable
    content available every time.</span></p>

    <span class='c16'>Other rating services &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; generally these services
    (a) focus on products rather than information, (b) require membership or charge you a
    fee, (c) use volunteers and not real experts, and or (d) use people who have a
    conflict of interest in what they rate recommendations. <b><i>QRata</i></b> is a free
    service focused solely on need-to-know, high utility quality of life content selected
    and recommended by unbiased experts in a respective topic and validated by users like

    <br /></a> <b><i><span class='c15'>QRata</span></i></b> <span class='c16'>ratings are
    the result of a rigorous, patented evaluation process. It starts with a basic
    criteria scorecard for evaluating a site, app or video&acirc;&euro;&trade;s
    operation, functionality, accuracy, and so on. Next, experts weight each of the
    criteria to reflect its importance in the overall evaluation of the topic. Then
    experts use the criteria to score the actual content offered. An average score for
    all the criteria is then calculated to create an overall rating for each content
    resource, which is then ranked against all content in the specific topic area. The
    result is rank order of the most reliable sites, apps and videos recommended by
    <b><i>QRata</i></b>. In addition to user challenges, our team of editors and quality
    control people audit this process continuously to ensure you obtain only superior
    content results.</span></p>

    <p><a name="rating_3" id="rating_3"><span class='c19'>What are the basic rating
    criteria?</span><br />
    <br /></a> <span class='c17'>At a minimum, criteria include scope, coverage,

    <p><a name="rating_4" id="rating_4"><span class='c19'>Is the difference between the

    on average the top 5 - 10 sites, apps or videos in a topic area. In other words, we
    only offer you the best-of-the-best content. So, while there is always some notable
    difference between content listed within a given topic, a lower rating - thus a lower
    ranking - does not imply the content resource is a less worthy of consideration.
    Rather, a higher rating, and thus ranking, often implies a site, app or video has
    more of the elements, features and attributes you would want if you had to choose
    just one site. Since all <b><i>QRata</i></b> recommendations undergo the same
    evaluation process, most of the time the lower rated and ranked content offers
    something unique or different that may be more specific or relevant to what you are
    seeking. In other words, the content may have some strength or feature that makes it
    valuable or special in comparison to other top-rated content within a given topic
    area. This unique or specialize aspect is usually identified in the
    expert&acirc;&euro;&trade;s content summary adjacent to the rating score and can be
    quite helpful.</span></p>

    <br /></a> <span class='c17'>It is hard to say in the abstract. <b><i>QRata</i></b>
    experts screen and evaluate many aspects of many content resources before they
    recommend their top resources picks. Note, however, with our patented evaluation
    process we do not ask experts to directly compare and evaluate one content resource
    against another. Rather, we have them compare each resource against the highest
    standard that can be set in each topic area. Consequently, any particular resource
    may excel in some criteria and be deficient in others. Since we limit the number of
    top-rated and recommended resources listed in a given topic, many otherwise good or
    average resources do not make it into our database. Key to the real benefit of our
    rating approach is that it both reduces any unconscious bias an expert may have and
    assures you they are objectively rating and recommending only the most reliable
    content possible. That said, if you think there is a site, app or video that is
    superior to one of our listed and recommended resources in a topic, we want you to
    tell us about it immediately. If you are correct we will happily pay you a cash
    reward and email you our expert's evaluation of it (click <u>here</u> to learn
    more).</span></p>

    <p><a name="rating_7" id="rating_7"><span class='c19'>Can I learn how and why an
    expert rated a particular site, app or video the way they did?</span><br />
    <br /></a> <span class='c17'>Yes, of course. Click the rating score number next to a
    review. There you will find a copy of the expert's specific rating for each criterion
    and read the evaluation. Note that if you disagree with the expert you can rate the
    quality of their judgment on each these criteria. Immediately after you submit your
    vote the consensus user score instantly tabulated and displayed.
    <b><i>QRata&acirc;&euro;&trade;s</i></b> goal here, as always, is to transparently

    not provide the best information compared to another higher rated resource in that

    content while others fall behind on needed improvements or changes in the topic area.
    Sometimes our experts just do not know certain content exist or has changed. This
    &acirc;&euro;&oelig;Cash for Better Content&acirc;&euro; program was designed to do
    two things:</span></span></p>

    <p><span class='c31'><span class='c16'>1.<span class=

    <b><i>QRata</i></b> experts and what are their qualifications?</span><br />
    <br /></a> <span class='c17'>All <b><i>QRata</i></b> experts are selected for their
    expertise in both the respective subject area and related Internet content. Experts
    include librarians, consultants, journalists, academics, professionals, and
    associations. You can find the names, background, qualifications, and affiliations of
    each expert in our "Experts" section (click <u>here</u> to learn more).</span></p>

    <p><a name="experts_2" id="experts_2"><span class='c19'>How are <b><i>QRata</i></b>
    experts selected?</span><br />
    <br /></a> <span class='c17'>Library and information specialists, and various
    professional associations and organizations provide recommendations of possible
    experts. Based on those recommendations and an expert's availability, interest, and
    any potential conflicts of interest <b><i>QRata</i></b> selects those best able to
    meet our needs.</span></p>

    <p><a name="experts_3" id="experts_3"><span class='c19'>Do your experts receive any
    compensation from the content providers they evaluate and recommend?</span><br />
    <br /></a> <span class='c17'>Absolutely not! First, <b><i>QRata</i></b> will not use
    the services of any expert with any conflict of interest with any provider. Second,
    any expert found to receive such compensation violates their contract with
    <b><i>QRata</i></b> and is terminated immediately and a new expert found and topic
    content rated anew. <b><i>QRata</i></b> is an independent, unbiased service designed
    to benefit you as a user exclusively. Your trust - in our independence, objectivity
    and quest to provide the most reliable content available on the Internet - is our
    most valuable asset and primary concern.</span></p>

    decide expert ratings and recommendations are reliable?</span><br />
    <br /></a> <span class='c17'>First, since our experts are carefully screened and
    vetted before they are recruited, we have the utmost respect for their integrity.
    Second, we know that each one has exceptional knowledge of both the subject area and
    the related Internet content. Third, each expert signs a contract stating that they

    recommendations. Fourth, both in voting on expert ratings and user suggested superior
    content. Fifth, making the expert&acirc;&euro;&trade;s rating process transparently

    favor the opinion of experts over the opinion of web users?</span><br />
    <br /></a></span> <span class='c33'><span>Actually, <b><i>QRata</i></b> encourage
    regular users to rate our experts. Next to every expert rating of a site, app or
    video we display the aggregated score of these user ratings. We also encourage all
    users to suggest content to superior to what experts recommended to add to
    <b><i>QRata</i></b>.</span></span></p>

    <p><span class='c33'><span>That said, our emphasis on experts reflects the fact that,
    you are seeking the most reliable content. Thus, you want to have confidence that
    someone who knows the topic thoroughly has systematically evaluated the relevant
    content before any specific content is recommended. Someone who truly knows the
    difference between superior content and content that is merely good or mediocre. Who
    knows the difference between what is the most up-to-date content versus and what is
    stale. Few users have this in-depth knowledge or engage in the type of exhaustive
    evaluative comparisons as topic experts do.</span></span></p>

    <p><span class='c33'><span>Finally, as witnessed with many so called rating services,
    there is always a concern about the potential for individuals or groups to seeking to
    skew or manipulate ratings results in some way for some particular reason or benefit
    contrary to your interest in objective reliability.</span></span></p>

    <p><span class='c33'><a name="objectivity_2" id="objectivity_2"><span class=

    <p><span class='c33'><a name="objectivity_4" id="objectivity_4"><span class=
    'c25'>Does <b><i>QRata</i></b> accept advertising?</span><br />
    <br /></a></span> <span class='c33'><span class='c16'>Yes. However, advertising comes
    from third-party services and has absolutely no connection to our experts or their
    evaluation process. We will not operate in any other way. We value your trust
    &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; in our unbiased objectivity and the integrity of our evaluation
    process, ratings and recommendations &acirc;&euro;&ldquo; above all
    else!</span></span></p>

    <p><span class='c33'><span class='c30'>Why do some organizations have their brand
    logo on <b><i>QRata</i></b>?</span><br />
    <br /></span> <span class='c33'><span class='c16'>After a content provider has been
    selected and recommended by our experts as having superior content, that provider can
    purchase space adjacent to its review to accentuate superiority in its topic
    category.</span></span></p>

    <p><span class='c33'><span class='c15'>If a recommendation is discontinued brand
    logos are also discontinued. Thus, no amount of brand promotion can lead to either
    inclusion in our service or an enhanced rating. Doing otherwise would create a
    conflict of interest that would undermine your trust in <b><i>QRata</i></b> ratings
    and recommendations. We will not allow that.</span></span></p>
